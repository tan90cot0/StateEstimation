# State Estimation Using Kalman Filters
This project is about state estimation using kalman filters, EKF, Landmark Localisation and solving the Data Association problem, and was done as a course assignment for COL864 - Special Topics in Artificial Intelligence - Odd Semester - 2023-2024.

## Directory Structure
1. Questions.pdf - Contains the questions related to Kalman Filters, EKF and Data Association Problems.
2. Report.pdf - Contains the relevant answers and analysis.
3. main.py - Contains the code to run the project.
4. requirements.txt - The file which contains the library/module requirements for the project.

## How to Run?
1. Change directory to the current directory and run pip install -r requirements.txt
2. run python3 main.py 
3. All the plots will be generated/overwritten in the folder named plots. If only a few plots are required, the same can be selected inside main.py (all the function calls are placed at the end of the program).
